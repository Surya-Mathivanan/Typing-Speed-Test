# Typing Speed Test (Spoken Style)

Hello everyone,

My project is called Typing Speed Test.  I started building this project as a way to learn React.js. Since I was just beginning with React, I chose a simple and interactive project to help me grasp the core concepts of React components, state management, hooks, and user interaction handling.

My main focus during development was on the User Interface (UI). I spent a lot of time designing a clean, modern, and responsive interface using CSS, because I wanted the user experience to be visually appealing and smooth.

### Technologies Used:

* Frontend Framework: React.js
* Styling: CSS
* Hooks Used: useState, useEffect, useRef

### Key Features:

* **Typing Paragraph Generator**: Randomly displays a paragraph for the user to type from a set of predefined ones.
* **Real-time Typing Feedback**: Each character typed is compared live with the original paragraph and visually marked as correct or incorrect.
* **Typing Statistics Calculation**: Automatically calculates:
	+ WPM (Words Per Minute)
	+ CPS (Characters Per Second)
	+ Accuracy (%)
	+ Time Elapsed
* **Strict Mode**: When enabled, it disables backspace/delete to make typing more challenging.
* **Dark & Light Theme Toggle**: Users can switch between light and dark themes for better readability and user preference.
* **Restart Button**: Resets the test and loads a new random paragraph.

### What Makes It Special:

* Fully built using React functional components and React Hooks.
* Great practice for beginners learning conditional rendering, form handling, and basic UI logic.
* The strict mode encourages discipline for typists and helps them build better accuracy.
* Dark mode improves accessibility and readability.

### Learning Outcomes:

* I learned how to structure a React project using state, side effects, and refs.
* I practiced user interface design and responsive layout creation using CSS.
* I understood how to break down features into manageable, reusable components in React.
